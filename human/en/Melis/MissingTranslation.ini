name = "Missing Translation String";
description = "This string is used, but is not defined. It will display its literal figure, leading to a bug in the interface.

Translation strings must be stored in the ``/language/*.interface.php`` files : all of them. 

Check the spelling of the translation string, as a typo may be the cause of the problem. The typo may be in the definition file or at call-time.

In ``/language/en_EN.interface.php`` : 
<?php

return array(
            'tr_string' => 'string',
            'tr_eror'   => 'error',
            //... other strings
            );
?>


In ``view/view.phtml`` : 
<?php

echo $this->translate('tr_error');
?>
